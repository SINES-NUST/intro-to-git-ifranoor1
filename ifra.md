## :octocat: Git and GitHub

What i learned from this course, the git is used to track the history of the projects. Like the screenshot is taken after every change you made. The github provide the user interface for easy interaction and understanding.

### :smile: fundamental of git and github

* repositories: They are a great way to store and share your code. They are also a great way to collaborate with other developers.

* cloning: cloning is used to make a copy on your local computer, sync them to made changes in both git and your computer.

* add and commit: when you make any changes first you can add by "git add . " and after these changes are ready to made So, you can commit it by using " git commit -m "message" 

* push: after commit, you can add your changes to the remote (github) repository

***This is the workflow of github that i learned after going through the course***
